let mainHeight = main.scrollHeight - main.clientHeight;
main.scrollHeight: The total height of the content inside the main element, including content that's out of view (i.e., content that requires scrolling).
main.clientHeight: The visible height of the main element, which is the area visible without scrolling.
mainHeight: This calculates the difference between the total content height (scrollHeight) and the visible area (clientHeight), effectively giving you the height of the hidden content thatâ€™s currently not visible (the scrollable area).


let scrollPosition = main.scrollTop;
main.scrollTop: This property gets the current vertical scroll position of the main element. It returns the number of pixels that the content of the main element has been scrolled vertically.

scrollPosition: This stores the current scroll position (in pixels) from the top of the main element. A value of 0 means it's at the top, and a larger value indicates how far down the content has been scrolled.


let progress = scrollPosition / mainHeight;
Explanation: Calculates the scroll progress as a fraction of the total height.
Result: progress will be a value between 0 and 1 indicating how far the user has scrolled (where 0 is the top and 1 is the bottom).

let progressPercentage = (progress * 100 + "%");
Explanation: Converts the progress value into a percentage for display.
Result: progressPercentage is the scroll progress as a string (e.g., "50%"), which is often used to show progress in a visual indicator (like a progress bar).
